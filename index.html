		<h2> About Me: </h2>
		<p> I am rising senior at Wellesley College pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Biology.  Building from my initial exposure to computer science at The Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI), I have pursued other projects and courses relevant to my developing interests.  Be sure to check them out below!! </p>

		<p> I am a current junior at Wellesley College pursuing a degree in Computer Science (and a minor in Biology).  The world of computer science was shown to me after my freshman year in college.  Over the summer I worked at the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI) on bioinformatics projects that included running alignment algorithms on sequence of DNA and running chi-squared tests on potential SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) to determine the significance of the mutation across genomes.  While I initially was drawn to the work due to the biology aspect of it, I came away having a new found interest in computer science.  The following year, I took a computer science class and loved it so much that I immeadiately declared my major.  </p>

		<p> Building from my intiial experience in STSI, I have pursued other projects and courses relevant to my devloping interests.  Some of my favorites are linked below! </p>

		<p> When I'm not busy staring at a screen and typing away, you can usually find me on the squash court - I play for the Wellesley Varsity Team and thoroughly enjoy it... TO BE UPDATED  </p> -->
