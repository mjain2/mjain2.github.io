I am currently a Seattle-based software engineer at Microsoft, working in Azure Data on open source database offerings, like Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. 

Outside of work, I also am passionate about STEM education and function as the chief operating officer for [Nuevo Foundation](https://nuevofoundation.org/), a nonprofit that aims to inspire kids to be curious, confident and courageous about discovering the world of STEM. 

I previously studied at Wellesley College, where I obtained a degree in Computer Science and Biology.  Building from my initial exposure to computer science at The Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI), I have pursued other projects and courses relevant to my developing interests.
