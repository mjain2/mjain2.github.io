Writing is not my forte.  It is something I do for emails and work, yet I love reading the writings of other people.  Like any other skill, it is something that can probably get better with practice, so here I am, writing the first blog post of my site, trying to figure out if this sounds too cheesy or has many run-on sentences (very likely, based on this sentence alone).  

Either way, this space will exist now and in the future as sort of a scratchboard for my thoughts.  Some may be technical, some may be thoughts on current events, and some may be silly! I'm giving myself this space to play around.

If you're here reading this, welcome! Thanks for being here.
